// Four Type of Access Modifiers

 /*
  * Public: The member or function is accessible from any other class.
  * Private: private can only acess within the same class .
    not within same package but differnt class right and also not from the other package in same class.
  * Protected: protected means we can access it in the same package (any class), and also from a subclass 
    in a different package â€” but not from non-subclass classes in different packages (even if the class name 
    is the same)
  * Default: The member or function is accessible only within its own package. It is also called package-private.
